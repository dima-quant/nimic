# Ndsl
NDSL is a pure Python module that facilitates writing AOT compilable code. Based on ctypes built-in module, it includes emulation of native types, pointers and operations on them, implementing dispatch, operator overloading, and templates. NDSL closely follows Nim programming language, to which NDSL code transpiles.
